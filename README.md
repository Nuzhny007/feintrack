A motion detector for video surveillance system.

1. Background subtraction algorithm based on Gaussian or Mixture of Gaussians model for each pixel.
2. Depends of the OpenCV (only for video capture and visualization) and CMake.
3. Detector has CUDA implementation of the background subtraction and segmentation algorithms.
